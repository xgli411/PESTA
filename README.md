# PESTA：Real-time Video Fall Detection Based on Human Pose Estimation and Skeletal State Analysis

## Introduction
Here is the paper we will publish "Real-time Video Fall Detection Based on Human Pose Estimation and Skeletal State Analysis". 

Here's how we improved the specific network structure of YOLOv7Pose

## Fall Detection Demo
Below is a video example of our method being tested on the fall detection dataset. It includes various poses like sitting, squatting, bending, walking etc. It also contains videos where no fall has occurred.
